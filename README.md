**Example HTML5 apps for the Boxee Box browser**

Use these examples to jump-start your leanback app!

Dive into the individual app directories to learn more about each approach.

rss-app
===

A leanback video rss feed viewer.

A simple node.js backend turns rss feeds into json.  The client javascript uses jQuery, Underscore, and the Boxee html5-fullscreen-player to display a simple menu navigable using the d-pad, which shows fullscreen video once a video is selected.


sproutcore-app
===

Similar to the rss-app, using the same node.js backend, but the client uses the SproutCore 2.0 javascript framework, which results in a different approach to handling keyboard input and managing application state.  SproutCore has a bit of a learning curve, but it is very powerful.
